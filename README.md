# Detect and Handle Null Values

This repository contains resources and examples for detecting and handling null (missing) values in datasets using Python. It focuses on practical techniques to identify missing data, analyze its impact, and apply various strategies to clean and preprocess data for machine learning and data analysis tasks.

## Project Overview

Handling missing data is a crucial step in any data science or machine learning pipeline. This project demonstrates:

- How to detect null or missing values in datasets  
- Techniques to handle missing data such as removal, imputation, or transformation  
- Use of dummy variables for categorical data preprocessing  
- Practical examples using the Ames Housing dataset  

The repository provides Jupyter Notebooks that walk through each step with clear explanations and code samples.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Ames Housing dataset**, a popular dataset for regression and data cleaning tasks. The dataset files included are:

- `Ames_all_numeric_dtype.csv` — Dataset with all numeric features  
- `Ames_outliers_removed.csv` — Dataset with outliers removed  
- `Ames_without_null.csv` — Dataset with missing values removed  

Additionally, the file `Ames_Housing_Feature_Description.txt` provides detailed descriptions of dataset features.
